# CUED Finite Element Methods (3D7) Lab

This is the laboratory coursework activity for the Finite Element Course
(3D7). The activity is contained in a Jupyter notebook and uses the open
source [FEniCSx](https://fenicsproject.org/) libraries.

Running the coursework notebook in Colab is recommended. Google does
very occasionally make changes to Colab that can break the required
libraries. In this case the lab can be undertaken using
[Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces) or run locally.


## Colab (recommended)

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/garth-wells/CUED-3D7-Lab)

At the start of each session it will take a few minutes for the required
libraries to be installed.

Cambridge users should use their University credentials (CRSid) to log
in.

> Be sure to use "Copy to Drive" to keep a copy of your notebook.


## Codespaces

[![Create a new Codespace](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/garth-wells/CUED-3D7-Lab)

You can return to your Codespace at https://github.com/codespaces.
Codespaces core hours per month are limited, so it is helpful to stop
running Codespaces at https://github.com/codespaces when you have
finished working. You can restart the Codespace at any time.


## Locally

1. Open VS Code.
2. [Clone](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git#_clone-a-repository-locally)
   the repository `garth-wells/CUED-3D7-Lab` from GitHUb using from VS
   Code.
3. Follow the instructions to install 'Dev Containers'.
4. Select 'Reopen in Container'.

You will be promoted to install Docker.

### macOS and Linux only

The DOLFINx library used in this lab can be installed using
[conda](https://conda.io).

```shell
conda create -n fenicsx-env
conda activate fenicsx-env
conda install -c conda-forge fenics-dolfinx=0.7.3 jupyterlab matplotlib mpich python-gmsh pyvista
```
